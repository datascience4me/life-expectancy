# life-expectancy
This repository is a small practice project based on a CS1 project assignment. CS1 students complete an assignment using Python that involves parsing a couple of text files for data, manipulating the data with a few data structures, and creating some plots to be displayed to the user.
I decided this project would be a decent practice project for modern C++ on a more powerful platform to contrast with my typical embedded environment.

The only dependencies this project will have is on Qt Charts, for generating the plots. The build environment is a Debian-based Linux distribution using CMake and GNU Make.

For a thorough description of the assignment, check out the `project_description` directory for PDF assignment document as well as a ZIP file containing all of the files given for this project in the normal class.
